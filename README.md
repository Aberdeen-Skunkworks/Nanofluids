# Nanofluids

Project background:

Moore's Law is a well-known phenomenon that states that in highly dense integrated circuits (IC) the total number of transistors will approximately double every two years. Thermal management becomes unrealistic as the density of transistors with in the IC increase, thus a new challenge has appeared in heat transfer: cooling of nano-scale devices. A more efficient and compact design of heat exchangers is required for advanced nanoelectronics, and one way this can be achieved is through nanofluid technology. A very large enhancement of the thermal conductivity of a base fluid (i.e. water) can be achieved by the addition of highly conductive solid material in the form of nanoparticles. The mechanics of this enhancement have generally fallen into the classical/continuum bounds given by series and parallel resistances. These bounds are defined by two separate phases of the solid nanoparticles and the liquid medium and the arrangement of the nanoparticles with in the medium. But a small number of experimental result do not fall into these bounds such as helium and hydrogen gas mixtures or the theoretical hard sphere model, which instead exhibit conductivity enhancements above the parallel bounds and dehancement below the series bounds. This project is to explore this phenomena, both experimentally and theoretically, and to attempt to model its effects.

Project Objectives

• Review nanofluids and their history in thermal conductivity enhancement. This includes describing what models have already been used to approximate their behaviour and critically review their applicability.

•	Construct a Transient Heated Wire cell for the testing of liquid and gas mixture thermal conductivities and use this data to explore the anomalous heat transfer in nanofluids and gas mixtures which have similar dimensional properties to nanofluid systems.

• Perform molecular simulations of thermal conduction to confirm if transient effects in the thermal conductivity, possible at small time/length scales, dominate conduction. These simulations may be molecular dynamics simulations using DynamO, or coupled kinetic theory-hydrodynamics simulations using code developed by Craig Moir, a PhD student at Aberdeen

•	Explore new heat exchanger designs which incorporate any time-dependent anomalous phenomena
